# Evaluating-AET-and-PET-values

Evapotranspiration (ET) is a fundamental factor in energy and hydrologic cycles. The precise simulation of evapotranspiration is essential for ecological restoration, agriculture and water resources management. Evapotranspiration is equal to the fraction of potential evapotranspiration (PET) constrained by soil water. In this proposed work PET values are estimated in real-time with meteorological observations globally using 3 Energy-based equations and 5 Temperature-based equations. Evaluation of PET values has shown that Energy-based equations are more accurate.However, the challenge lies in accurately simulating daily evapotranspiration through PET. Non linear functions, Linear functions and Complementary Relationship functions between ET and PET have been developed. The evaluation showed that the accuracy of ET simulation using Non-linear method are better than other methods.
